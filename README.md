For detailed explanation, visit [my devblog](http://pedro-javierf.github.io)

## Warning
I do not take any responsibility for this tool usage in malicious purposes. It is free, open-source and provided AS-IS for everyone.

## TODO
- Add OS detection in the loader to exploit other dll hijacking entrypoints
- Improve loader stability (Dll Injector)
- Refactore CopyItem to ensure copy in C:\\

## Known Isues
- explorer.exe can't unload injected stage2 dll. Process reboot is required.
