# Twicexploit
Open source implementation of an UAC bypass exploit, based in 2 windows failures.

## Warning
I do not take any responsibility for this tool usage in malicious purposes. It is free, open-source and provided AS-IS for everyone.

## System Requeriments
- A windows machine (Works with Vista/7/8/8.1/10)
- Admin account with UAC set on default settings required.

## TODO
- Add OS detection in the loader to exploit other dll hijacking entrypoints
- Improve loader stability (Dll Injector)
- Refactore CopyItem to ensure copy in C:\\

## Known Isues
- explorer.exe can't unload injected stage2 dll. Process reboot is required. 
- code is pretty old and shouldn't be used anymore
